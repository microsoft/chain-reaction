You're outside of a windowless room. The room has three light bulbs and three switches outside the room. Each switch controls one of the light bulbs. You may only enter the room once. How can you find out what switch goes to each light bulb?,"Turn on the first switch and wait 5 minutes. After 5 minutes have passed, turn off the first switch and turn on the second switch. Go into the room and feel the bulbs to see which one is warm. You'll know that bulb matches the first switch. The bulb that's on belongs to the second switch. You now know the third switch belongs to the last bulb."
How do airplane wings allow planes to fly?,"The top part of an airplane wing is curved while the bottom is flat, and because the air stream passes from one edge of the wing to the other in equal periods of time, this leads to a lower pressure on the top of the wing than on the bottom of the wing. The accompanying pressure difference (according to Bernoulli's principle) creates the lift force that gives the plane lift and helps it get off the ground."
